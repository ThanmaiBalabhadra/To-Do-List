# To-Do-List


A "To-Do List" is a tool to organize and prioritize tasks you need to accomplish. It helps improve productivity and time management by listing tasks with deadlines and priorities. You can use traditional paper or digital apps like Todoist or Trello. Key practices include setting clear, achievable tasks, prioritizing important ones, and regularly updating the list. This helps reduce stress and provides a clear path to completing your goals.
